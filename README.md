# Suchat - A chat web app
A frontend chat web app build in React following the video [Build A Chat App( Text, Video, Image) 1 (React JS, MongoDB , Redux, Socket Io )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYP54qp4aMM&list=PL9a7QRYt5fqlDRSRZCtqhVCg_r5U9idbF)

Although I followed most of the video instructions, I did some chages in order to train some abilities. I splitted the app into 2 repositories one for the frontend and another to the backend called api-suchat built in Go. Another change that I did was use some hooks in this frontend.
